# Workout Tracker

## Overview
This app is designed to keep track of your daily workouts. You're able to add them as you like and view them in a chart on your workout dashboard. The dashboard uses both graphs and pie charts to show your stats.
The database was created using MongoDB and used Atlas to link it to Heroku.
